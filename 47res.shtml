            <h1>Research interests</h1>

            <p class="grey">My research interests fall into three broad categories: 
	    nonlinear waves, coagulation processes, and mathematical medicine and biology. 
	    Please contact me if you are interested in 
	    pursuing a PhD in any of these areas. </p>

	    <p class="blue"><b>Nonlinear Waves</b></p>

            <p class="grey"><b> - Travelling Kinks and Breathers in FPU-Klein-Gordon lattices:</b> 
	    - I started working on solitons on lattices for my PhD thesis, and have continued, 
	    expanding to cover more complex modes and higher-dimensional lattices.</p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Breathing of DNA:</b> 
	    - this is one application of breathers on lattices, 
	    but with Charlie Laughton, we have worked on parameterising stochastic 
	    differential equation models using AMBER. </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Fluxons in Josephson Junctions:</b> - 
	    collaborative work with Hadi Susanto is focused on understanding 
	    a range of nonlinear dynamics relevant to current and potential 
	    nanotechnological devices.  </p>

		<p class="grey"><b> - ICMS meeting on Nonlinear Waves and Solitons on
		Lattices</b> - 
		in April 2011, there was a meeting in honour of Chris Eilbeck on his 
		retirement. Details of speakers, talk titles, abstracts are available <a
		href="http://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/jadw/jce/">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="blue"><b>Coagulation-fragmentation problems</b></p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Polymer nucleation:</b> - collaborative work 
	    with Richard Graham focuses on the effects of flow, stretch, nuclei orientation, etc.  </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Origins of Life:</b> - 
		I am interested in modelling the chemical processes which occur during 
		the formation of chiral polymers/crystals, also the information storage of 
		primitive DNA/RNA sequences, and simple metabolic processes by which 
		cell-like structures form. </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Island growth during deposition:</b> - for example 
	    in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), the continuous deposition of atoms on a surface 
	    causes islands to form; the size distribution of these islands often follows a 
	    self-similar form. 
	    I am interested in analysing the large-time asymptotics of this process. </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Generalised nucleation theory:</b> 
		I am interested in analysing a range of techniques, for example asymptotics 
		of the Becker-Doring equations, as well as the Smoluchowski equations,  
		and approximation techniques based on coarse-graining and 
		continuum limits. </p>

            <p class="blue"><b>Mathematical Medicine and Biology</b></p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - mRNA degradation:</b> 
		together with Dr Cornelia de Moor of the School of Pharmacy at Nottingham, 
		I am working on the processes by which the poly-A-tails of mRNAs are 
		eroded, leading to the destruction of mRNA. </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Carbohydrate and Fat metabolism in humans:</b> 
		I am collaborating on the construction of computer simulations 
		of human nutrition and the development of various metabolic 
		conditions such as diabetes and fatty liver disease. </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Carbon metabolism during seed germination:</b> - 
	    I work with Mark Hooks (Bangor) on mathematical models of  
	    fluxes in and through the peroxysome/glyoxysome. </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Metabolic pathways in ovarian cells:</b> - 
	    recent collaborative work with Kevin Sinclair (Biosciences, Nottingham) 
	    and Helen Byrne (Oxford) aims to model the methionine cycle.  </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - Telomere dynamics, and the influence of cell cycle 
	    on drug treatment:</b> - the evolution of telomere lengths is a 
	    process which can be modelled by discrete dynamical system 
	    that can be analysed using asymptotic techniques.   </p>

	    <p class="grey"><b> - DNA condensation for gene therapy:</b> - 
	    this reduces to a classic toy problem in physics, 
	    namely random sequential adsorption (RSA), also known as the parking 
	    problem.  I am interested in deriving solutions to certain cases using 
	    asymptotic limits, and connections with MBE (see above), since both 
	    are described by coagulation-fragmentation processes. Earlier work 
	    in this area involved Snow Stolnik and Clive Roberts (Pharmaceutical 
	    Sciences, Nottingham) and Helen Byrne (Oxford). </p>
